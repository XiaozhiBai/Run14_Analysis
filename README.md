**Measurements of open bottom and charm hadron production in Au+Au collisions at STAR experiment**

In this analysis, the primary goal is to measure the open bottom and charm production in in Au+Au collisions at âˆšsNN = 200 GeV, which is studied by the measurement the electrons from the open heavy flavor hadrons via semi-leptonic decays. This is the fist time at STAR measured the charm and bottom quark production separately in heavy-ion collisions by the track impact parameter method.

** How to run the analysis**

1. produce the heavy flavor decay electron DCA template from data daiven fast simulation
* cd FastSim
* starver SL16d
* source setup.csh
* cons.csh
2. Photonic electron back ground DCA can be produced by the Hijing+Geant4 full detector simulation 

3. Hadron back ground extracted from data

4. Inclusive electron and Photonic electron pair reconstructed from data
