**Measurements of open bottom and charm hadron production in Au+Au collisions at STAR experiment**

In this analysis, the primary goal is to measure the open bottom and charm production in in Au+Au collisions, which is studied by the measurement the electrons from the open heavy flavor hadrons via semi-leptonic decays. This is the fist time at STAR measured the charm and bottom quark production separately in heavy-ion collisions by the track impact parameter method.

The details can be found in this [Phd. thesis chapter 4. ](https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/files/PhDthesis_0.pdf) chapter 4.


**How to run the analysis**

1. Produce the heavy flavor decay electron DCA template from data daiven fast simulation
    * cd FastSim
    * starver SL16d
    * source setup.csh
    * cons.csh
2. Photonic electron back ground DCA can be produced by the Hijing+Geant4 full detector simulation 

3. Hadron back ground extracted from data

4. Inclusive electron and Photonic electron pair reconstructed from data
